Neverending Beauty
The sun sets and rises every day,  
Painting hues of oranges and pinks that fade away.  
But morning comes again with the rising light,  
Bringing with it a new day and a new sight.  
Birds sing sweet melodies that fill the air,  
As flowers bloom, displaying their beauty with flair.  
The world is alive with splendor and grace,  
From the mountains and seas to every little space.  
So let us cherish this wondrous earth,  
For its neverending beauty is of infinite worth.
